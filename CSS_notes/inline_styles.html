<!-- Inline styles are styles applied to a particular HTML element through the element's style attribute.
They are considered inline because the styles are written in line with the HTML; the style attribute is part of the HTML.
These inline styles are great if you want to test a style on an object before moving the style to another location
or if you have only one object that needs a particular CSS style.

Inline styles take precedence over internal or external style sheets.
This means that if different styles are defined for a specific element
in the HTML page, using an external sheet,
an internal sheet, and an inline style, the inline style overrides any other styles,
and the browser will format the content using the inline styles.

Note that the styles in an inline style only apply to a particular element,
so you cannot use inline styles for multiple elements without actually copying
and pasting the style set from one element to the next in the HTML content -
a process that is time-consuming and can lead to errors.

Another pitfall of inline styles is that they cannot be used for pseudo-elements
and pseudo-classes. This means that if you are using a colon (:) in your
CSS selector, you will not be able to apply an inline style to it. Inline styles
also cannot be used for styling the multiple states of links such as hover,
visited, and active; those can only be styled in internal style sheets and
external style sheets  -->


<!-- Internal style sheets are CSS rules that are grouped together inside the HTML style tags in the <head> of an HTML document.
  These styles automatically apply to all relevant content on the page,
  making it easier to ensure that all elements with specific attributes are formatted the same throughout the page.

Note that these styles are page-specific, so they cannot be shared across multiple pages.
Also, because they are part of the page itself, they also can slow down how long
it takes a page to load. However, internal style sheets are a good choice if you
have a few styles that will apply only to specific elements on a single page.

Here is an example of some styles that may appear in an internal style sheet -->

<style>
  a {
    text-decoration: none;
  }

  a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
  }

  .warning {
    font-weight: bold;
    color: red;
  }

  div .warning {
    font-style: italic;
  }
</style>



<!-- External style sheets allow you to share styles across multiple pages,
allowing you to create a consistent look and feel throughout your website.
As the term implies, an external style sheet is literally a separate file that
contains only CSS styles. Like an HTML page, it can only contain text, but the
content is formatted using style set syntax, and the filename must end in .css.
Most code editors that support HTML also support CSS, so you can use the same
tools to write both HTML and CSS code.

There are two ways to connect to an external style sheet: through the link HTML
element or through the CSS @import command.

In an HTML document, you could link to an external style sheet like this -->

<link rel="stylesheet"
      type="text/css"
      href="sampleStyles.css" />

<!-- The rel attribute is set to stylesheet, which identifies that we are linking to a style sheet file.

The type attribute is set to text/css; this identifies that we are linking to a file that contains CSS.

The href attribute tells the browser where to find the external .css file;
in this example, the file is named sampleStyles.css and it is in the same directory as the current HTML file.

In this case, the CSS file is part of the website, and the path used in the href
attribute describes where the file is located within the website, using an
address relative to the current HTML page  -->


<!-- When to Use Which? -->
<!-- An inline style applies to one specific object.
If there is a particular object that needs to be styled precisely, an inline style may be the way to go.

An internal style sheet applies to one specific page.
If there is a style that applies to multiple elements on a page, an internal
style sheet may be easier to manage than dealing with copied-and-pasted styles in inline styles for each element.

An external style sheet applies to any page that references it.
If there is a consistent look and feel that applies to multiple pages,
an external style sheet may be the way to go.  -->
