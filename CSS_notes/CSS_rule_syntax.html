<!-- There are important terms that you need to be familiar with when navigating CSS,
including rule sets, selectors, declarations, properties, and values.
Like HTML, CSS is not case-sensitive â€“ technically, you can type it in any case you want, and it will still work.
However, CSS is most often keyed in lower case, like HTML. Also like HTML, line breaks are completely optional.
However, you are encouraged to use line breaks to make the code easier to read -->
